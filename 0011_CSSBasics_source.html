Best practice is to use Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to control both the layout 
and the look and feel of a page

They come in 3 flavors:

&middot; remote file &lt;- best practice;

&middot; "in-file", where they are defined, usually in the &lt;head> section;

&middot; and "inline" where they are defined inside an html tag
example: &lt;p style="color: blue;">blue text&lt;/p>

To start while you are learning we will put them in-file.

You do this with a &lt;style> &lt;/style> tag in the head
section of the html document.

You only need one style tag, but you can have more - the style definitions in 
each will be appended to the list as if they are all within the same style tag.

Inside of style definitions are properties.  Properties are the aspects of
an html element that you wish to control, such as font size or color, etc.

Each property is listed with a semi-colon followed by the desired value. If
there is more than one property defined in a style definition they should be
separated by a semi-colon, as shown in the example below.

For example:

&lt;head>
&lt;style>
    #foo {
        color: red;
        font-size: 10px;
    }
&lt;/style>

&lt;style>
    #foo {
        color: blue;
    }
&lt;/style>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
&lt;p id=foo>This text will be font size 10 and color blue.&lt;/p>
&lt;/body>


Styles are implemented using various 'CSS Selectors'.  The selectors are
applied from most general case to most specific case, regardless of what
order the style definitions are listed in the style sheet:

&middot; 'wildcard' (*) refers to all html elements. This style does not need
to be explicity called, just defined.

&middot; 'element' (such as h1) refers to all html tags of that type. Again,
this style does not need to be explicity called.

&middot; 'class' (such as .boldItem) refers to a bunch of things
by the same class name.  This is defined with a period before the class
name in the style sheet, and does need to be referenced in the element tag.

&middot; 'id' (such as #firstName) refers to one and only one
thing on a page.  This is defined in the style sheet with a hashtag
symbol before the id name, and does need to be referenced in the element tag.


When applying styles, the last property value read will be used.  In the case 
that several selectors of the same type are used, each applicable property 
will override what was previously defined in the order that they are called.


Examples:

&lt;head>
&lt;style>
    * {
        color: purple;
    }
    #myid {
        color: blue;
    }
    .myClass {
        color: red;
    }
    .myOtherClass {
        color: green;
    }
    h1 {
        color: orange;
    }
&lt;/style>
&lt;/head>
&lt;body>
&lt;h1>This will be orange&lt;/h1>
&lt;div>This will be purple&lt;/div>
&lt;p id="myid">This will be blue&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="myClass">This will be red&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="myClass" id="myid">This will be blue&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="myClass, myOtherClass">This will be green&lt;/p>
&lt;/body>

Each html tag has different styles that will work for it, and each property
has specific values that it will accept.
