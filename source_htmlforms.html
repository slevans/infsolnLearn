One way to transmit data from the web to the server is
through an html form

You 'submit' the data that is entered through a number of
means, the most common is via 'submit button'

There are various different types of data entry controls
available...

Most of them are described with the '&lt;input />' tag, such as &lt;input type=text>

To get a text box like you would put your name or city into

Other types are checkbox and radio

A submit button is &lt;input type=submit>

To declare a form on a page, you use &lt;form> &lt;/form> tags

And all the input types etc go in between them

There are two ways to send the data to the server... POST and GET

With GET, the variables are visible in the url
http://example.com/form.php?name=suzy&job=homemaker
With POST they are behind the scenes

The form tag has attributes that tell the page: 1. whether
to use post or get, 2. what the name of the form is, if any (generally for
use within javascript), and 3. what page to load when the form is submitted.

That looks like: &lt;form method=POST name=blah
action=blah.php> &lt;/form>

It is a good idea to use quotes around attribute values....
&lt;form method="POST" name="blah" action="blah.php">

So, when the data is sent to the server, the variable name
is the name of the input field:
&lt;input type="text" name="favColor" />

The variable name will be 'favColor' and the value will be
whatever the user typed in. In php that looks like $_GET['favColor'] = 'green';
or $_POST['favColor'] = 'green'; (or $_REQUEST['favColor'] = 'green'; - which
includes both POST and GET vars).

Those are 'superglobal variables' that are available to
your php script when a form is submitted or whatever.

If you go to a url that has the variables listed behind it,
it is the same as submitting a form to that page.

other input types are also textarea, for big blocks of
text, that looks like... 
&lt;textarea name="myText">Here is the default that
will show inside the text box&lt;/textarea>

And drop downs are done with select tags...
&lt;select name="fruit">&lt;option value="apple">Apple&lt;/option>
&lt;option value="orange">Orange&lt;/option>&lt;/select>

And buttons, which are generally used in conjunction with
javascript to process input before submitting it to the server:
&lt;input type="button" name="myButton" value="Click to do
something" onClick="javascript:doSomething();" />

You can also pass default values into the controls
&lt;input type=text name=myName value="Suzy" />
The box will show with 'Suzy' filled in already

With checkboxes, the user can click any number of them to
select them

With radio buttons, the user can only select one of the
group at a time
Controls can be styled with css like any other html tag

On checkboxes and radio buttons to set a default you have
to use the keyword 'selected'... it is different for both of them.

There is also a password field that replaces
whatever you type with ***** (but still sends to the server in plaintext).

For radio button, it is 'checked'... &lt;input type="radio"
name="numbers" value="1" checked /> One &lt;input type="radio" name="numbers"
value="2" />Two
And can only check one in a set of radio buttons
Checkboxes same thing but you can check as many as you want

Selected denotes the default option in a drop down
&lt;select name=blah>&lt;option value="a" selected>A&lt;/option>
&lt;option value="b">B&lt;/option>&lt;/select>
