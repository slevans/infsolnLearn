	<dt>Data</dt>
		<dd>Pieces of information that are processed by a software program.</dd>
	<dt>Database</dt>
		<dd>A software server designed to efficiently store and access data.  Databases are a key component of dynamic applications, particularly for the web.</dd>
	<dt>File system</dt>
		<dd>The way a computer organizes and accesses files.  Windows Explorer is a file system management utility.</dd>
	<dt>Firmware</dt>
		<dd>Software that is installed directly onto hardware by the manufacturer.</dd>	
	<dt>Hardware</dt>
		<dd>The physical machinery that makes up a computer.</dd>
	<dt>Host</dt> 
		<dd>The particular machine, either physical or virtual, that is running a software server responding for a service.</dd>
	<dt>Network</dt>
		<dd>Two or more computers connected together.</dd>
	<dt>OS</dt> 
		<dd>Operating System.  Windows, Linux, etc.  The software that gives instructions on how to access and use the computer's hardware.</dd>

		<dd>Tiny unit of data containing information being transferred across a network and instructions for delivery and re-assembly.</dd>
	<dt>Protocol</dt>
		<dd>The technology standard under which information is formatted, transmitted, and received over a network.</dd>

	<dt>Server</dt>
		<dd>The machine or software that sends a response to a request.</dd>
	<dt>Server-side</dt>

	<dt>Service</dt>
		<dd>The software that processes data according to a particular protocol.</dd>
	<dt>Software</dt>
		<dd>Coded instructions for computers and computer systems. aka programs.</dd>
	<dt>System</dt>
		<dd>Ambiguous term, can mean a collection of software, hardware, or both.</dd>
	<dt>Unix</dt>
		<dd>A type of operating system that comes in many varieties both proprietary and open source including Linux, Solaris, BSDI, etc.  Key differences between Windows and UNIX are:
 		<ul>
		<li>On UNIX all drives are "mounted" onto the file system to look like native folders, whereas Windows assigns drive letters such as E:\</li>
		<li>The directory slashes go the other way: /home/jane/myfile.txt  vs.  C:\home\jane\myfile.txt</li>
		<li>There is no program registry on UNIX.  All items in UNIX file systems are treated as files, including programs.  There is no virtual aspect to an installed program, as exists on Windows.  Instead file permissions are used to determine if a file can be executed.</li>
		<li>UNIX machines can be accessed and manipulated remotely via command line using telnet, or a number of other protocols.</li>
		</ul>
