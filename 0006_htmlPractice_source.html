HTML in Practice

Now is the time to get your hands dirty!

Follow these instructions to participate in infsoln learning:

1. Learn the materials in Section 1, Chapters 1 - 5.

2. Send email to: training@infsoln.com with your name, time zone, and a request 
to participate in the training program.

3. Within 72 hours (ish) you should receive an email back with your coding
and review assignments.  As long as you are participating in training, 
these pages will be yours to create and maintain.

4. Convert the source content in your section into html.
Do not worry about fonts, font sizes, bold, etc. - that will come later 
in the css chapter.

5. Once you have converted one or more of your pages to html, email it as an 
attachment to the training email address.  Please name your files using a
four-digit chapter number with leading zeros... 0011_CSSBasics.html for example.

6. Your code will be reviewed and posted or returned for edits.
As other students review your pages, you will receive ongoing requests to 
modify your pages accordingly.

7. When you have completed your review assignments, which include creating 
quiz questions for other students' sections, send a separate email for each
chapter to the training email address.

8. Once you have converted all five (ish) of your section pages to html and
they have been reviewed and posted, then move on to study Chapter 11, CSS Basics.
Your next set of instructions will be presented in Chapter 12, CSS in practice.
 

Please Note:

Each page should reference the infsoln logo at the top: infinite_logo.jpg
and have a page title that matches the title on the outline.

Remember, Ctrl+U will show you the source code of any web page in your browser.
This is handy when trying to figure out how something was done on a page.

The first step is to get the content on the page using the best tags for the job.
For example, for definitions lists it would be best to use the dd tags -
they are similar to table tags: http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_dd.asp

It is probably best to use h1 tags for the title to show on the page.

Some pages may be tricky because you want to show the html tag in the training
content.  For these, replace the less-than character (<) with &lt; to prevent
your browser from parsing it. 
(See more available codes at: http://www.ascii.cl/htmlcodes.htm)

Feel free to browse through the tags that are available and try things out, but
make sure content looks consistent from item to item on a page, and from page
to page.

Take as much time as you want or need to complete each section and each task!

If you have any questions getting started or regarding any of the content 
send your questions in email: training@infsoln.com
