<h1>Web Basics with PHP Training</h1>
<p>This is an entry-level training program that will take you through an
introduction of web development with php.
</p><p>
Each participating student is assigned a block of training material pages to 
convert for 
web as we cover the topics in each chapter.... html, css, javascript, php, etc.
</p><p>
This has the ulterior motive of getting my training materials online, so it is 
a tremendous help to me!  At the same time, I am here for one-on-one questions, 
and the ultimate goal of this training is to provide entry level people with 
the knowledge needed to take on some paying project work.
</p><p>
So far everyone who is doing the training is very part time, covering about one 
chapter per week. 
</p><p>
Below you will find the chapter outline grouped into sections. 
There are some other advanced topics I'd like to cover, so the outline will 
change and grow as I assemble additional information.
</p>
<p>For students who do not wish to particpate hands-on, please feel free to
ask questions on the content or to embellish it.  All questions pertaining to
the training program may be sent to: training@infsoln.com</p>
<p>
<h2>How to participate in web training</h2>
<p>Step one is to learn the material in Section 1, which begins html training.</p>

<p>When you get to Chapter 6, <i>HTML in practice</i>, you can begin participating
in the training program. Follow the instructions in that chapter to sign-up
and to receive your assignments.</p>

<p>As you progress through the information in each chapter, you will apply the 
principles to the chapters in your assigned section.</p>

<p>Additionally, every student is asked to provide feedback on content, 
perform code reviews,
 and create quiz questions for other students' sections.</p>

<p>Good luck, and I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
