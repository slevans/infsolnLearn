<title>FTP - how to</title>

FTP stands for file transport protocol

This is one method used to move files to or get files from another computer, 
typically a server.

We will be covering some UNIX basics later, but in our case the server is 
running Linux.  Linux has a file system similar to Windows or Mac made of files 
in directories.

While it is possible to ftp from a command prompt, there are many applications 
available to facilitate transferring files.

My preference is FileZilla: https://filezilla-project.org/download.php

Once you have downloaded and installed an FTP client, you create a configuration 
for the ftp server you would like to connect to.

In FileZilla you can do this in the File menu > Site Manager.

Click 'New Site' and type a label for this server that will appear on the 
shortcut menu.

A user must have been created on the server, or the server must have a guest 
user set up, in order for you to ftp files to and from the server. If you are
an infsoln student, one will be created for you and the credentials emailed
once you have reached this chapter in the learning.

In FileZilla, now enter the Host information.

For Infinite Solutions, the server name is infsoln.com.  Leave Port blank.

By default SFTP (secure ftp) uses port 22, ftp uses port 21 but the server 
administrator can change it.

For protocol, select 'SFTP'.

Next, enter your login credentials under Logon Type 'Normal'.

Click 'OK', then 'Connect'.

By default, in the left hand pane you will see your local filesystem, and on the 
right the remote (server's) file system.

Double click on a file to move it to or from the server, or you may drag and 
drop files into the interface.

If you are an infsoln student, for now please upload any file changes for your 
section to your directory instead of sending them in email. Soon 
you will get a folder in your user directory that gets served from a sandbox 
website, so that you can move php files to a server for testing.

Remember, you are responsible for maintaining and organizing your own directory.

FileZilla will allow you to create your own folders on the server to organize 
your files in if you like.

Also note that the user directories on the infsoln server are not backed up in 
any way - if you delete the contents of your folder, there is no undo!
